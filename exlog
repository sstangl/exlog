# Going off of Jordan's program at this point, in order to:
# 1) Salvage the strength built. He suggested keeping the @10 sets but
#    just using triples instead of fives, which I think would dig an
#    even deeper recovery hole CNS-wise.
# 2) Spend less time training. Currently it takes 3.5-4 hours, since all
#    the sets are so difficult that I have to rest 10-12 minutes between each.
#    If I do lighter sets, or focus more on conditioning, I can cut that down.
#    Also if I put related lifts together to allow safe warmup skipping,
#    or just perform only 2 lifts a day. Or make the 3rd BB-style.
# 3) Regain some enjoyment. I miss talking to people about programming,
#    I miss programming myself, and I miss understanding how each set
#    fits specifically into a bigger training picture.

  # tendinitis. Things learned:
  # 1) "Chin down" / "Look down" cue wasn't working before because the neck
  # musculature was loose: as Simma Park said, think of raising chest to chin.
  # Then everything is locked.
  #
  # 2) Stance was too wide. Bringing in stance allows knees to travel to tips of
  # toes.
  #
  # 3) Knees sliding forward is a result of loss of _quad_ tension.

# Thanks to Blice, we looked at Practical Programming again for advice on
# TM stalls -- the Monday-Monday, Friday-Friday progress lines are only
# for starting TM. Stalling likely indicates too much of a Monday stressor,
# providing insufficient recovery for Friday. Dropping back on Monday
# squats and having them increase at a slower rate might solve it. Taking data.
